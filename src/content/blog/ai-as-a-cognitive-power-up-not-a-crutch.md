As developers, we’ve always used tools to extend our abilities—editors, debuggers, CI/CD pipelines. But AI is something different. It’s not just a tool—it’s a *cognitive partner*. And how we use it matters.

If you’re just letting Copilot fill in code or Claude explain docs, you might feel faster. But are you getting smarter?

### The Research-Backed Advantage

Recent studies show LLMs and agentic systems can:
- Extend your working memory
- Scaffold complex problem-solving
- Support reflective thinking

> “AI can support metacognition and scaffold reasoning.”  
> — *Shenhav et al., 2017*

Used well, AI can be a power-up for your mind. Used poorly, it becomes a shortcut to stagnation.

### What Cognitive Offloading *Should* Look Like

**Bad offloading:**  
“Write the code for me.”  
No context. No critique. No growth.

**Good offloading:**  
“Here’s what I’m trying to build.  
Here’s what I’ve thought through so far.  
What am I missing?”

That’s not outsourcing—it’s augmenting.

### Three Prompting Habits of High-Cognition Devs

1. **Reflect Before You Prompt**  
   > What am I trying to do? Where am I stuck?

2. **Co-Think, Don’t Cope**  
   > Use AI to simulate pair programming or second-brain debugging.

3. **Refactor the Prompt**  
   > Just like code, your first draft isn’t your best.

### From Code to Cognition

Being a Full Product Developer means:
- Owning your outcomes
- Asking better questions
- Staying curious—even when the AI is fast

AI can scaffold your thinking.  
But it can’t replace your responsibility to think.

## Try It: Prompt Templates

**Prompt 1: “What would a senior dev look for here?”**  
Use to challenge assumptions and grow your mental models.

**Prompt 2: “Explain this in 3 levels: beginner, intermediate, expert.”**  
Use to reinforce learning across knowledge depths.

**Prompt 3: “What are 3 alternatives I’m not considering?”**  
Use to avoid tunnel vision and unlock options.

## TL;DR

- AI isn’t here to think *for* you—it’s here to think *with* you.
- Use AI as a scaffold for reasoning, not a crutch for laziness.
- Better prompts → better cognition → better developers.
