## 👋 About the Talk

Most developers use GitHub Copilot to finish lines of code—but what if you could guide it to *think* with you?

In this 45-minute session, originally presented for a .NET User Group Meetup, we explore how to move beyond autocomplete and into intentional collaboration. You’ll learn how to use reusable prompts, custom instructions, and chat modes to steer Copilot more strategically.  
We also walk through how **“Planning Mode”** lays the groundwork for powerful **“Agent Mode”** results—and how one team used this approach to accomplish in 20 minutes what normally took three days.

Whether you're just getting started or ready to level up your AI-assisted .NET workflow, this talk will give you practical tools and a fresh perspective on how Copilot can become more than just a typing assistant.
