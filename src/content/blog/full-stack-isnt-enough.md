In today’s fast-moving, AI-accelerated world, being a “full stack” developer isn’t enough. In my original article, [Full Stack Isn’t Enough: The Rise of the Full Product Developer](https://leantechniques.com/2025/05/06/full-stack-isnt-enough-the-rise-of-the-full-product-developer/), I argue that true developer excellence now means understanding product goals, user needs, and the “why” behind every decision—not just mastering the tech stack.

**Full Product Developers** go beyond code. They:
- Focus on outcomes, not just output
- Collaborate deeply with product and design
- Question whether a feature should be built at all
- Use AI tools to accelerate delivery, but rely on judgment and product fluency to drive impact

As AI handles more of the “how,” our value shifts to knowing what to build and why. Teams need developers who think upstream, challenge assumptions, and align on real value.



I also shared these ideas in my talk at DevOpsDays Austin—[watch the talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CF9fg_CCkg).
