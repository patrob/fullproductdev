Most devs treat prompting like it’s a magic incantation.
Say the right words, get the right answer. Done.

But in reality, prompting well is less about clever phrasing—and more about context.

You can ask the exact same question two different ways and get wildly different results depending on what the AI knows. And in high-leverage work—where the goal isn’t just a code snippet but a strategic outcome—context becomes everything.

## Prompting is Product Thinking in Disguise

When you prompt an AI, you’re not just issuing a command. You’re setting direction. Framing the problem. Guiding the conversation.

That’s product thinking.

As devs, we’ve always had to ask:
- What problem are we solving?
- Who’s it for?
- What does success look like?

The difference now? We’re not just answering those questions in our heads or in meetings—we’re encoding them into our prompts.

If you’re fuzzy on the outcome, the model will be too.

## The Real Lever: Context

Prompting without context is like asking a stranger to finish your thought mid-sentence.
Sure, they might guess correctly. But odds are, they’ll go in the wrong direction.

Context is the lever that turns AI from a helpful tool into a real partner.

This could mean:
- Supplying background on the user or business case
- Pointing to specific code patterns or domain concepts
- Framing constraints, risks, or priorities
- Using examples that show nuance

It’s not about verbosity—it’s about relevance. The more signal you give, the less the model has to guess.

## Tools Like Copilot Are Context Builders

GitHub Copilot Chat, ChatGPT custom instructions, reusable prompt templates—these aren’t just conveniences. They’re scaffolding for better context.

Here’s how we’re starting to use them:
- Custom chatmodes for specific thinking styles (like “Code Forensics Copilot” for analyzing legacy code with business goals in mind)
- Prompt libraries that walk us through feature planning or architecture tradeoffs
- Saved instructions that shape the assistant’s “mental model” of our product, not just our code

It’s not about getting to code faster—it’s about getting to clarity faster.

## From Idea to Implementation

When you’re working on something new, there’s a natural fog. You don’t know what the solution looks like yet, and even the problem might be fuzzy.

This is where prompting with context shines. Product thinking helps you ask smarter questions early—so you can feed the AI enough signal to move from discovery to decision to delivery.

You’re not just saying, “Write a function.”
You’re saying, “Given our goals, users, and constraints, what’s the best way to approach this?”

That’s the difference between asking for output and prompting for impact.

## It’s Not One-Shot Q&A—It’s System Design

High-leverage prompting isn’t about the one-liner that gets you a clever answer. It’s about designing systems of interaction:
- Structured prompts that mirror product thinking
- Chatmodes that guide decision-making
- Workflows that evolve as you build context

You’re shaping not just what the AI says, but how it thinks with you.

## Final Thought

Prompting well isn’t a party trick. It’s a skill that blends product insight, user empathy, and creative thinking. And it’s only going to get more valuable.

The devs who win with AI won’t just write better prompts.
They’ll build better context.
And that’s where the real leverage is.
